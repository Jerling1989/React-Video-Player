# React-Video-Player
This is a video player app where the user can search for a video topic and get the relevant results they would like to watch. It was coded with HTML, CSS, and ES6 JavaScript, as well as using technologies and frameworks like Node, React, Youtube API, and Bootstrap. Some of the Node packages I've used in this app are express, lodash, react, react-dom, and youtube-api-search.

- The first thing the user will see upon the app loading is a simple interface with some video data already loaded. For this project I saw it fit to have the homepage loaded with videos on React. Below the main video is the video title, the name of the channel that published the video, and a brief description of the video.

- Whenever the user searches a video topic in the top search bar the app will use the YouTube API to find the top 5 most relevant videos for that search. The app automatically fetches the results of the user search every time they change the search term.

- This is the completed user search from the previous screenshot above. This is used to demonstrate how the user can view instant results of their search query as they are typing it out.
