# React-Video-Player
This is a video player app where the user can search for a video topic and get the relevant results they would like to watch. It was coded with HTML, CSS, and ES6 JavaScript, as well as using technologies and frameworks like Node, React, Youtube API, and Bootstrap. Some of the Node packages I've used in this app are express, lodash, react, react-dom, and youtube-api-search.
